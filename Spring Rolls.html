         a small roll of thin pastry filled with vegetables 
         and sometimes meat, and then fried.</p>
    
         <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    
     <ul>
        <li>2 ounces rice vermicelli</li>
        <li>8 rice wrappers (8.5 inch diameter)</li>
        <li>8 large cooked shrimp - peeled, deveined and cut in half</li>
        <li>2 leaves lettuce, chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fill a large bowl with warm water. Dip one wrapper into the hot water for 1 second to soften. Lay wrapper flat; place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center, add some vermicelli, lettuce, mint, cilantro, and basil, leaving about 2 inches uncovered on each side. Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with lettuce. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>For the sauces: Mix water, lime juice, sugar, fish sauce, garlic, and chili sauce in a small bowl until well combined. Mix hoisin sauce and peanuts in a separate small bowl.</li>
        <li>Serve rolled spring rolls with fish sauce and hoisin sauce mixtures.</li>
